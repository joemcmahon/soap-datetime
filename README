SOAP::DateTime

This is a little utility module that converts dates into the 
format required by the SOAP 'xsd:dateTime' type.  It's just a
dumb little wrapper around Date::Manip, because that's the 
lazy way to make sure that we are forgiving in what we accept.

To install:
  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install
